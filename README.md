## Philosophy

I'm a **T-shaped person** - combining broad expertise across multiple domains with deep knowledge in specific areas. As a **scanner personality**, I thrive on acquiring knowledge and sharing it with others. I'm passionate about helping people develop their abilities and interests, and I apply the same dedication to my own continuous growth.

My approach: **Practice first, theory follows.** I believe experimentation is the most efficient way to create and transfer knowledge - "Learning by doing" scales beautifully, even with larger groups.
