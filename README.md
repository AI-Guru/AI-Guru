## Hi there 👋 I'm Dr. Tristan Behrens

I'm a researcher, developer, and AI enthusiast specializing in **AI for music generation**, **small language models**, and **AI sovereignty**. Based in Heilbronn, Germany, I'm passionate about making AI more accessible, efficient, and democratized.

### 🎵 What I Do

- **Music AI Research**: I curate comprehensive resources on music generation and AI, maintaining the popular [Music Generation Research](https://github.com/AI-Guru/music-generation-research) repository (598+ ⭐) and creating innovative projects like [MMM-JSB](https://github.com/AI-Guru/MMM-JSB) for multi-track Bach chorale generation.

- **Small Language Models**: Creator of [Helibrunna](https://github.com/AI-Guru/helibrunna) (76+ ⭐), a Hugging Face-compatible framework for training Small Language Models, with support for xLSTM, Mamba, Pharia, and Transformer architectures.

- **AI Infrastructure**: Building practical AI tools including [ai_services](https://github.com/AI-Guru/ai_services) for AI sovereignty, [chatterbox-fastapi](https://github.com/AI-Guru/chatterbox-fastapi) for conversational AI, and various workflow automation solutions.

### 🏙️ Community & Contributions

I'm dedicated to Heilbronn, one of Germany's most creative AI hubs, and actively support open-source AI development. My work is sponsored by [KI Salon](https://www.ki-salon.net/) and collaborates with institutions like experimenta, Bildungscampus, 42 coding school, IPAI, STACKIT, and Dieter Schwarz Stiftung.

### 🔬 Key Projects

- **[xlstm-resources](https://github.com/AI-Guru/xlstm-resources)** (318+ ⭐) - Comprehensive resources about xLSTM by Sepp Hochreiter
- **[arxiv-reader](https://github.com/AI-Guru/arxiv-reader)** (62+ ⭐) - Text-to-speech for arXiv papers
